It’s what all universities look for, which is why this little document can help determine whether you get into your dream college or not.

This will help you better understand who exactly you are writing to and what they would be looking for in a candidate. You can modify your personal statement based on it. The next thing you need to do is to brainstorm and generate ideas about what should be included in your personal statement. Think about your life-defining moments, your hobbies, interests, or anything that you are passionate about, your inspirations, and the moments that you are most proud of. Write it down as a list. Discuss with your family and friends and see if they have anything else to add. Shortlist the ones that you want to talk about.

Each of the ingredients has its qualities and specific role in the dish and if chosen correctly and cooked right, it gives you the best results possible. Well, cross-functional collaboration is kind of similar to this. The basic idea of cross-functional collaboration is to get a bunch of people with varied skill sets and expertise into one team for a specific project or task. These teams help in tackling tasks and projects that require a set of different skills and are especially helpful in getting such tasks done efficiently. Studies have even shown that strong cross-functional collaboration has a success rate of nearly 76%. It’s something every department and company needs to do. If you want to know more about it, this is the right place to be!

  "content": "As an employer, you know that hiring isn’t exactly a walk in the park. But if you thought hiring was difficult, then you’ll realize that employee retention is the real challenge. Surely, it’s hard to miss the fact that employees no longer feel the need to serve companies that do not serve them. Simply speaking, people are not shy to walk away from their jobs if they feel dissatisfied. This means that the job markets can be highly competitive with companies struggling to retain their existing employees and attract new ones. Worried? Well, the fact is that HR is not entirely powerless in this case. Studies show that 77% of the reasons behind employees quitting are actually preventable. You just need to find the issues quickly and address them before it’s too late. If you think your company is at risk of losing employees, you need to up your game and start implementing employee retention strategies immediately! Lucky for you, we have compiled a list of some of the most impactful employee retention strategies in this blog! But before we get to that, let’s understand why employee retention is important.
